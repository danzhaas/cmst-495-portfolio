The main requirements for this project were that it needed to include a working toolbar, text editor, file management, and basic authentication. Users can make edits in the text editor and incorrect spelling prompts the mistakes. The toolbar consists of basic functions like bold, italic, underline, etc. Each document can be titled, users can create new docs, etc.   The tech stack was the MERN stack and React.js, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, CreateReactApp, React Router, and SASS."

A hybrid communication platform combining features popular in Discord and LinkedIn, it has message boards and chat rooms; also, developers can create their own profiles and link to their github accounts and share their education and work history.  The design emphasizes connections and conversation: in the chat window, developer names and conversation titles have a bold weight, and icons encourage clicking to read user profiles.  In the profile pages, the “White Space is Not your Enemy” philosophy is utilized as to space out the information about each user. "

The tech stack is Gatsby, React, React Router, JS, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS. and SASS.  The user interface has been designed to be minimally distracting: it has a small footprint on the page so it can be put in the bottom corner of a computer screen or displayed in full on a smartphone screen while the user works.  The timer itself can be hidden as well so the ticking seconds are not a distraction.  The graphs were designed with a consistent binary color scheme for simplicity: blue is distracted time, gray is focused time."

It functions to deliver information about the event, and the site map was based around user stories.  The site serves people who are just learning about the event for the first time and will likely come as spectators, hobbyists who may want to participate in the fish show by entering their own fish, and sponsors and vendors who seek to access this audience’s interest.  The design is inspired by the beautiful fish themselves: the palette includes bold oranges, teals, reds, and blues that can be seen in images of the fish themselves.  The background is a fish tank to immerse the user in the world of the aquarium from the moment they enter the site."
